**Project Description:**

"Sports Basics" is an emerging sports blog focused on delivering engaging and insightful content. As part of our initiative to increase website traffic and capture the attention of cricket fans, analysts, and teams, we are launching a special edition magazine focusing on the IPL 2024 season. The primary objective of this project is to offer data-driven insights that will appeal to various stakeholders in the cricket world, leveraging advanced data analytics to provide valuable, actionable information.

The project uses data from multiple sources, including player performance statistics and match outcomes from the past three years of IPL, extracted from key tables such as `dim_match_summary`, `dim_player`, `fact_batting_summary`, and `fact_bowling_summary`. These data sets were meticulously cleaned and transformed using Power Query to ensure accuracy and reliability before beginning the analysis.

## Data Modeling and DAX:

Once the data was cleaned and prepared, I established strong relationships between the tables in Power BI. This foundation allowed for the creation of advanced DAX measures, which are crucial for performing detailed calculations, such as batting averages, strike rates, bowling economy rates, and more. These metrics formed the core of our analysis, offering deeper insights into player and team performance over the past seasons.

## Data Visualization:

Using Power BI, I created a comprehensive dashboard divided into sections that cover various aspects of the game:

1. **Team Statistics**: Insights into team performance across seasons, with focus on winning percentages, best performance under pressure (chasing targets), and overall trends.
2. **Batting Statistics**: Metrics on the top batsmen, their runs, averages, strike rates, and boundary percentages.
3. **Bowling Statistics**: Key insights on the top bowlers, including wickets, economy rates, and dot ball percentages.
4. **Best 11 Players**: A curated list of the top-performing players across all categories, including batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders, selected based on data-driven analysis.
5. **Predictions for IPL 2024**: Insights into the potential top teams, players, and match outcomes based on historical data trends.

The visualizations are designed to be interactive, with users able to drill down into specific player statistics, team comparisons, and performance over different IPL seasons. Additionally, I used tools like Canva to create engaging presentations, ensuring that the report is not only insightful but also visually appealing.

## Key Insights:

- **Top Players**: Identifying the top 10 batsmen and bowlers based on the past 3 years of data, factoring in metrics like total runs, batting average, strike rate, wickets, economy rate, and boundary percentages.
- **Team Performance**: Analyzing the top 4 teams based on winning percentages, as well as identifying the teams with the best records for chasing targets.
- **Player & Team Predictions**: Uncovering secondary insights such as the potential Orange and Purple Cap winners, the top 4 qualifying teams, and predictions for the winner and runner-up of IPL 2024.
- **Best 11 Picks**: A data-backed selection of the best 11 players for the upcoming season, considering both performance and research into current form.

Through this project, I not only gained a deeper understanding of cricket statistics but also honed my skills in data analysis, visualization, and presenting complex data in a user-friendly format.
